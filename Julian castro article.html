<p><b>Julián Castro, the former Obama-era housing and urban development secretary, is offering a broad vision for a potential presidential campaign and articulating the anxieties that he says communities of color face under President Donald Trump’s administration, as he publicly explores entering the 2020 Democratic primary.

“I’m clearly leaning in a certain direction,” Castro told BuzzFeed News over a brief phone call outlining his plans to fundraise and make potential staffing decisions ahead of a Jan. 12 announcement of his decision in San Antonio, Texas, where he served as mayor before joining the Obama administration. “We’ll be using the next few weeks to put the building blocks in place if there is a campaign.”</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Castro’s decision to publicly launch an exploratory committee for 2020 on Wednesday gives him a head start on traveling the country ahead of what’s expected to be a broad field of Democratic candidates. “Some folks have said, ‘Is it too early to form an exploratory committee or go forward?’ And I’ve got to move forward on my own timeline. I have a strong vision for the country’s future and I have no doubt there are going to be a whole bunch of other candidates in the race and they’re going to have their own plans and their own timelines, but I’m sticking to mine.”

Castro said that while his team is still finalizing a travel schedule for the next month, he plans on making public appearances across the country, including in some of the early primary states. “I’ve been to the first four states already, so I’m going to focus on those states if I get in and some of the states that vote on Super Tuesday, including Texas,” he said.

“Politics is always about your message, how hard you work to get support, and also timing. So I’m going to get out there and I’m going to work hard and I’m going to deliver a message about the country’s future and my experience of getting things done, and people are going to have a choice to make,” Castro said about visiting early-voting states in the primaries like Nevada, South Carolina, and New Hampshire.

“I’m confident if I decide to run I can win the nomination,” he added.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Castro, whose mother is a Chicana activist, hasn’t shied away from addressing racial and religious identity and its prominence in politics, a shift from 2010 when the New York Times Magazine reported that he was wary of referring to himself as “brown,” using the term “people of color” to describe Mexican Americans, and considered younger generations less burdened than previous generations.</b></p>
